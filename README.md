## dot-gradles
A collection of handy Gradle files which helps Java/Android development easier.

### Tasks
* [test-report](/test-report.gradle): Prints pretty messages for unit testing.

### Notice
All of them are collected somewhere on the earth. Some of them are modified by me or other human. So feel free to use, distribute, modify or do whatever you want without asking.  
If you has any useful Gradle build script to share, please make a PR. Thank you.
